                                                *angular*
There are separate javascript, html, and css runtime files, as well as lots of
other nice plugins that you may want to consider using if you're doing angular
development. See the README at https://github.com/burnettk/vim-angular for a
nice list.

NAVIGATING                                      *angular-navigating*

Get around efficiently in an angular project.

                                                *angular-gf*
gf                      Bolsters the original gf by also sending you to the
                        file under the cursor if the file has an implicit
                        "app" subdirectory prefix (a common grunt config). If
                        the word under the cursor is a service/directive/etc,
                        go to the file where it is defined. For example, if
                        your cursor is on BlahService, it will take you to
                        blah-service.js. If your filenames are not
                        dasherized, this will not work out well. Set
                        g:angular_filename_convention to either 'camelcased'
                        or 'titlecased' in your .vimrc.

                                                *angular-:A*
:A                      In a test file, edit the implementation, and vice
                        versa.  It basically looks for a corresponding file in
                        a directory that looks like it might include tests or
                        app code, respectively. If this doesn't work, it is
                        quite likely because the angular directory structure
                        convention you're using is not conventional enough.
                        That's ok; you can tell angular.vim where your source
                        and test directories are located with
                        g:angular_source_directory and
                        g:angular_test_directory.

                                                *angular-:AS*
:AS                     Like :A, but in a split.

                                                *angular-:AV*
:AV                     Like :A, but in a vertical split.

                                                *angular-:AT*
:AT                     Like :A, but in a tab.

RUNNING A SPEC                                  *angular-run-spec*

It doesn't actually run the spec, but it sure as hell looks like it does if you
have a karma watch going. Wut, you don't use karma watch? Dude!

                                                *angular-:AngularRunSpec*
:AngularRunSpec         Updates the spec where your cursor is sitting from
                        "it" to "iit" and writes the file. Why? Jasmine
                        notices that you have an iit spec, and, when you run
                        your test suite, it will only run that one spec. If
                        the spec is already "focused" (with "iit"), running
                        this command will toggle it back to "it." All of this
                        is much more effective if you have karma watching your
                        files and running your tests automatically when you
                        save files.

                                                *angular-:AngularRunSpecBlock*
:AngularRunSpecBlock    Perform the same dance as :AngularRunSpec but using the
                        describe block in which the cursor is sitting,
                        effectively running all specs inside the describe block.
